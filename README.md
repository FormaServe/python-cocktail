## Virtual Environment

As with all python projects, it is recommended to run this application in a virtual environment.  Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Create the Virtual Environment

Use the venv module to create a virtual environment inside the project folder. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv my_venv
```

Replace **my_venv** with your preferred name for the virtual environment.

### Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command based on your operating system:

#### On Windows

```bash
my_venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS, Linux or IBM i

```bash
source my_venv/bin/activate
```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When youâ€™re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:

```bash
deactivate
```

Remember to activate it whenever you work on your project. ðŸ˜Š
