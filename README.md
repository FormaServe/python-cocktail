Then in an internet browser, open the application at the following URL [http://localhost:3638](http://localhost:3638)

## Virtual Environment

As with all python projects, it is recommended to run this application in a virtual environment.  Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Create the Virtual Environment

Use the venv module to create a virtual environment inside the project folder. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
```

Replace **.venv** with your preferred name for the virtual environment if you don't like our naming convensions

### Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command based on your operating system:

#### On Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate

```

#### On macOS, Linux or IBM i

```bash
source ./bin/activate

```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you’re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:

```bash
deactivate

```

Remember to activate it, or recreate it, whenever you work on your project. 😊
